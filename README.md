# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project involves creating a server for the WTWR application. The project implements advanced techniques like working with databases, setting up security, testing, and deploying web applications on a remote machine. The end goal is to develop a fully functional server with an API and user authorization.

To run the project, execute the following commands:

- `npm run start`: This command launches the server.
- `npm run dev`: This command launches the server with the hot reload feature.

By executing these commands, you can start using the server and its functionalities without having to learn the underlying concepts.
